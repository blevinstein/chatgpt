# WhisperGPT

Simple application for interacting with ChatGPT via audio transcription (Whisper) and text-to-speech. Push and hold to talk.

## TODOs

- Persist chat conversations, allow resuming
- Add auth and productionize on AWS for internal use
- Prototype headless deployment (via text messages)
- Experiment with other special-token add-ons
